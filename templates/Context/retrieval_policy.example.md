# Retrieval Policy (Fast Path)

Default: automatic retrieval with adaptive depth.

## Retrieval ladder
1) Tier 1 (Index): check `Context/now.md` first.
2) Tier 2 (Targeted notes): read 1–2 likely nodes.
3) Tier 3 (Search): semantic + grep only if still missing.

## Output rules
- Answer directly.
- Prefer exact facts over narrative.

## Safety
- Never modify governance/system files.
- Keep filenames slugged and links clean.
